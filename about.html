            <h4>
                I’m excited to give you a detailed look into how I spent my summer, both during 
                my travels in Europe and through the fun times I had with friends. I hope you find the 
                photos and descriptions of these events as enjoyable as I did. Our summer was filled 
                with a diverse range of activities. We spent leisurely days at Lake Pleasant, soaking 
                up the tranquility and beauty of the surroundings. We also had a fantastic time swing 
                dancing at a lively restaurant, where the music and atmosphere made for unforgettable 
                memories. Each experience contributed to a season full of joy and adventure, and I can’t 
                wait for you to see all the moments that made it special. </h4>

        <div class="box2">
            <h1 class="superShadow">Inspiration</h1>
            <h4>I chose vibrant and cheerful colors like bright blues and lively yellows for my 
                project because they evoke the essence of summer, even though I’m not 
                particularly fond of the season itself. The images I selected resonated
                with me and captured the summer vibe I appreciate. Despite my aversion to the intense heat and my reluctance to spend time outdoors,
                I find blue to be an exceptionally beautiful color, much like the ocean. These colors and images help convey a sense of the season I 
                enjoy, even if I prefer to stay inside and admire its beauty from a distance.</h4>
