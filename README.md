## Installation and Running Locally

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal or command prompt and clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

Change directory to the project folder:

cd your-repository

3. **Install Dependencies**

This project uses external libraries via CDN, so there are no additional dependencies to install. Ensure you have a stable internet connection to load these libraries.

4. **Open the HTML File**

You can open the index.html file directly in your web browser. However, for a more comprehensive local development experience, use a local server:

Using VSCode Live Server Extension

If you use Visual Studio Code, you can install the "Live Server" extension. Right-click on index.html in VSCode and select "Open with Live Server" to launch the site in your default browser.

Using Python's Built-in HTTP Server

If you have Python installed, you can start a local server with:


python -m http.server
This will serve the files at http://localhost:8000. Open this URL in your browser to view the website.

Using Node.js HTTP Server

If you have Node.js installed, you can use the http-server package. First, install it globally if you haven't already:

npm install -g http-server
Then, start the server with:

http-server
The website will be available at http://localhost:8080 by default.

**File Structure**
index.html: Main HTML file.
styles.css: CSS file with custom styles.
places.js: JavaScript file for animations and interactions.
./images/: Folder for background and other images.
